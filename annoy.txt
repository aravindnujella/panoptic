Description of the model tried:

why can't I learn anything with the resnet model?
potential locations for mistakes:
1) iresnet could have some errors -> I've manually verified that there are no mistakes.
2) under representational power of the chosen model
3) under training
4) bad loss function: mask_loss, class_loss
5) bad design of class branch and loss branch: not taking translation equivariance into account
6) bad ordering of training data: several images from same image => batchnorm could behave in ...? way.
7)
